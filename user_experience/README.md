# User Experience

This section introduces a couple of techniques to greatly improve the user experience. With the accompanying code samples you should have these integrated into your bot in no time!

- [In-Chat Auth]((authenticate_in_chat/README.md)) - Authenticating and authorising the user from within the chat window so that the user does not need to fill out any forms or login from other UI elements.
- [Remember the User](remember_user/README.md) - Storing the user's name and session token locally so that we can restore the coversation and greet the user by their name when they return.
